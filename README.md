## Features Implemented as MVP

- API calls will be cancelled after error.
- At top showing page number and total data.
- I have intentionally added repetitive tags to show ellipse (...) on second line as per the design.

#### Here as per API's data will be fluctuated all the time

## Possible Enhancements

- [UI] There is always scope for an improvements of design.
- [Tech] Can be use SCSS to use it's inbuilt functionality such as functions, mixin etc.

## Setup & Development

### Prerequisite

- Make sure you have `node` installed -- recommended `6.4.1`.
- Once you have a `node` installed, run `npm install` in this repo to get your dependencies.
- (optional) `npm run build` to create build folder.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### Description / Data Flow / Approach

- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Reason: wanted to move quickly since this structure will give me minimum things I'd need to create a MVP.

Thank you!
